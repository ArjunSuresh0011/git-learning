	<p>Dear Eilen,</p>

	<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at university of Awesomes's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Post-Docterate">PhD</abbr> next year.Iwill answer your questions one by one ,in the following sections.</p>

	<h2>Starting dates</h2>

	<p>we are happy to accomedarate you starting with us at any time,however it would suite us better if you could start at the biggining of a semester;the start dates for each one are follows</p>

	<h2>Subjects of study</h2>

	<p>At the  Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minted reserch faculty - as long as the subjects fall somewhare in thee realm of science and technology.You seem like an inteligent,dedicated resercher, and jest like kind of person we&apos;d like to have on our team.Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we are most intrigued by are as follows ,in order of priority:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<ol type="1">

			<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine ,and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>11</sub>)</li>

			<li>Measuring the effect on perfomance of funk bassplayers at temparatures exceeding 30<sup>0</sup>C(86<sup>0</sup>F),when the audiance size exponentially increase (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)</li>

			<li><abbr title="Hyper text markup language"> HTML </abbr>and <abbr title="Cascading style sheet"> CSS </abbr> constuct for representing musical score.</li>

		</ol>
	</blockquote>

	<p>so please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,including how long you&apos;d expect the research to take,required staff angd other resoursces,and anything else you think we&apos;d need to know?Thanks</p>

	<h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

	<p>Yes,you are right As part of my post-doctorate work,I did study exotic tribal dances.To answer your question,my favorite dances are as follows,with definitions:</p>

	<dl>
		<dt>Polynasian chicken dance </dt>
		<dd>A little known but <em>very</em>influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens,to encourage thire livestock to be &quot;fruitful&quot;</dd>

		<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
		<dd>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Marking up a letter</dd>

	</dl>	

	<p>for more of my research,see my <a href="https://www.google.com" title="research website" target="_blank"> exotic dance research page</a>.</p>

	<p>Yours sincerly,<br>
